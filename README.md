# JavaCRUD

JavaCRUD is a Java program that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MySQL database. It simulates a book shop management system where you can enter book details like name, price, and edition, store them in the database, and perform various operations on the data.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- XAMPP or any other MySQL server setup to create the database and tables.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Install and start XAMPP or any other MySQL server.

3. Create a new database using phpMyAdmin or any other MySQL administration tool.

4. Import the provided SQL file (`database.sql`) into the created database. This will create the necessary tables.

5. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

6. Update the database connection details in the program to match your MySQL server setup.

7. Build and run the program.

## Usage

Once the program is running:

1. Enter the book details, including the name, price, and edition.

2. Select the desired operation: Create, Read, Update, or Delete.

3. Perform the operation on the book data.

4. View the updated book data or perform additional operations as needed.
